D3XpTracker
===========

Diablo 3 Experience Tracker version 0.1

Tracks experience per hour gained in Diablo 3 by analyzing the screen every 30 seconds.

It's still a very early version, so there are some limitations.  Since the program just looks at the xp bar to do it's calculations, it won't be accurate if the bar is covered up when the screenshot happens.  Also, if the background is very similar in color (blue), it may get false readings.  Try to make sure your paragon level and xp bar are visible when you start the program (or hit restart).  Diablo must be running at 1920x1080 and on the left monitor.
